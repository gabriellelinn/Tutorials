APS.NET MVC 5 Fundamentals- Web Application
 
I built this web application to dive into an unfamiliar topic of my choice. I value the fundamentals of learning anything new. 
I choose MVC becasue I wanted to learn a new framework that is popular in today's industry. I also was excited to learn this framework because it has a lot of neat advantages like the ability to support the ability to be asynchronous and how each part plays its own role.
